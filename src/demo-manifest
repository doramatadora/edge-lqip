## What's happening here?

Low-quality image placeholders (LQIP) are generated on-the-fly using [BlurHash](https://github.com/woltapp/blurhash), by a Compute@Edge service written in Rust ðŸ¦€ and compiled to WebAssembly. 

The code lives at [github.com/doramatadora/edge-lqip](https://github.com/doramatadora/edge-lqip).
