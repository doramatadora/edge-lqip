## What's happening here?

Low-quality image placeholders (LQIP) are generated on-the-fly using [BlurHash](https://github.com/woltapp/blurhash), by a Compute service written in Rust ðŸ¦€ and compiled to WebAssembly. 

Head over to the [LQIP tutorial page](/solutions/tutorials/low-quality-image-placeholders) for a step-by-step implementation guide.
